# velocity-podman
A rootless Podman container for the Minecraft proxy Velocity. 

## Personal Setup
I personally run this using Podman as running these containers rootless under a non-root user (i.e., a sudo-less user named 'mcserver' or 'velocity') provides more security than running it through something like the Docker daemon.
